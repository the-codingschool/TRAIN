Easy difficulty

The Anscombe's quartet dataset is a collection of four small datasets, each containing 11 points. Despite having similar statistical properties, the datasets are visually distinct, showcasing the importance of visualizing data. The quartet was created by statistician Francis Anscombe in 1973 to highlight the limitations of relying solely on summary statistics for data analysis. Each dataset consists of x and y coordinate pairs. Although the summary statistics (mean, variance, correlation) are nearly identical across the datasets, when plotted, they reveal different patterns, including linear, quadratic, and non-linear relationships, as well as outliers. The Anscombe's quartet dataset serves as a reminder of the significance of data visualization in understanding and interpreting data.

ML Algorithms:
The Anscombe's quartet dataset is primarily used to highlight the limitations of relying solely on summary statistics and to emphasize the importance of data visualization. As such, it is not typically used for machine learning tasks or algorithm training. Instead, it serves as a valuable tool for data exploration, statistical analysis, and data visualization exercises. 

Use the following to load the data:
```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(url)
```
