Cleaned dataset, easy difficulty

This folder contains three `.csv` files:
- `sms_spam_uncleaned.csv` - **original dataset** with  all original samples, some formatting issues, and unsupported characters.
- `sms_spam_unsanitized.csv` - good formatting, but still contains all samples (some of which are overly explicit/obscene).
- `sms_spam.csv` - **Recommended** 'clean' version. **Note:** this still contains samples with explicit language and/or suggestive themes, feel free to edit at your discretion.

Each file contains SMS messages with the following attributes: 
- **SMS** - text message content
- **Label** - indicates whether it is spam (0-not spam, 1-spam).
